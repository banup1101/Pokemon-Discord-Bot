# Pokemon-Discord-Bot
This Discord bot was created with JavaScript and Node.js. The purpose of this Pokemon Discord bot is to display information about a Pokemon such as what the Pok√©mon's name is, what type it is, what it's moveset is, etc. This information comes from PokeAPI, The main purpose of this was to teach me the basics of making a discord bot.
